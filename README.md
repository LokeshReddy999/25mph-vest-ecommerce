## ðŸ“– Project Overview 

The **25mph Vest Buy Page** is a clean, easy-to-use web page that helps people buy bright safety vests for kids and adults.

This project shows how to create a modern website that is simple, responsive, and user-friendly.

### The page includes:

- A clear and modern **header** with links to Home, Images, Buy, and Login pages  
- **Tabs** to switch between **Kids Vest** and **Adult Vest** options  
- Easy-to-use **plus (+)** and **minus (âˆ’)** buttons to change quantity  
- **Total price** that updates automatically when the quantity changes  
- A **size dropdown** to choose vest sizes  
- A helpful **size chart image** for picking the right fit  
- Clean layout, neat fonts, and fun emojis to make the page more engaging  

This project can be expanded in the future into a full online shopping page, and it's made with the goal of giving users a great experience.
